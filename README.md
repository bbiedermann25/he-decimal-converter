# he-decimal-converter


This program was design to convert Covid-19 Health Equity data from the Broadstreet 
Covid-19 data project into a format where cases represented as percentages are
changed into actual case counts. Entries that are percentages represent the 
percentage of the total amount of cummulative Covid-19 cases that come from a 
certain demographic at a certain date. Each entry that is represented as a 
percentage is changed into the actual number of cases by setting it equal to itself 
multiplied by the total amount of cummulative cases in the county at the given day.
